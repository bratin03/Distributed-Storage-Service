Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has earned the unfortunate tag of "chokers" in the IPL due to their consistent failure to clinch the title despite possessing some of the most talented players and dominating the league stage in multiple seasons. Since the IPL's inception in 2008, RCB has reached the finals three times (2009, 2011, and 2016) but faltered under pressure each time, losing to less-favored teams. Their star-studded batting lineup, featuring icons like Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, and Chris Gayle, often posted mammoth totals, yet their bowling unit struggled to defend scores or chase down targets in crunch games. This imbalance, coupled with questionable captaincy decisions and an inability to perform in knockout matches, has fueled the narrative. For instance, in the 2016 final, despite scoring 200+, they lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad due to poor death-over bowling. Fans and analysts point to RCB’s over-reliance on individual brilliance rather than a cohesive team strategy, making them a case study in how talent alone doesn’t guarantee success in high-stakes T20 cricket.
